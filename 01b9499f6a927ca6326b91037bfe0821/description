collections

introduce a new data structure - a "collection". 

a collection is a grouping of:
1. ent repositories
2. other collections

a collection is defined by some user-producible, machine readable file (maybe a TOML or something similar) and points to:
1. locations of other ent repositories (local or remote) 
2. locations of other collection files (local or remote)
