figure out how to make useful reports

In task-warrior we had a pair of custom reports, one to list things we
did last week and another to list things we were planning to do this
coming week.

Docs here:
* custom reports: <https://taskwarrior.org/docs/report/#custom-reports>
* end date (brief): <https://taskwarrior.org/docs/using_dates/#other-dates>


# Done last week

> report.weekly.prev.description='Tasks Completed Last Week'
> report.weekly.prev.columns=uuid,description.desc,project,assignee,end
> report.weekly.prev.sort=end+
> report.weekly.prev.filter=+COMPLETED and -hidden and (end.after=sow - 1 week) and (end.by=eow - 1 week)

The "done last week" report filters on a column called `end`, which is
a datetime made up by tw indicating when the ticket became COMPLETED.


# To do this week

> report.selected.external.description='Tasks Selected for This Week'
> report.selected.external.columns=project,description.desc,assignee,due
> report.selected.external.sort=assignee+/,urgency-
> report.selected.external.filter=-COMPLETED and -internal and -hidden and (due.by=eow or +selected or +interrupt)

The "to do this week" report looks for the tags "selected" or "interrupt",
or a due date this week.


# What is to be done

## Done last week

I can imagine finding the issues with state=done, running `git log` on
their state file, finding the datetime of the transition to done, and
selecting the ones where that datetime is in a particular time window.

This has the drawback that it's hard to lie about...  With taskwarrior
I often found myself finishing a task on Week X, but forgetting to mark
it complete.  Then the Monday of Week X+1 i would mark it complete.
If i didn't override the completion-date the task would look like it
was completed on Week X+1, not Week X like i wanted.

In git we have `git commit --date=DATE`, but that's only usable at
commit-time (and awkward to express to ent).  We can rewrite history with
`git rebase`, but only until we `ent sync`.

Maybe the `state` file should have a date in it, in addition to the
state word?  Or maybe `completion-date` should be a key in a per-issue
key-value store?  Is that kv store related to tags?  Idk...

Not sure how to express to ent what completion-dates i want to see.
Maybe a new filter type?  `ent list finished=2025-07-01..now`?

Maybe we can use git tags in the entomologist-data branch somehow?
`git log` between tags and look for "state: _ -> done".  But how to
position the tags on the commits i want?  Seems cumbersome.


## To do this week

entomologist doesn't have due dates yet, but we should probably add that.

entomologist doesn't have tags yet (there's an open ticket for it),
but once we have that it'll be easy to list "tags=selected,interrupt".
Or maybe we should just use "state=inprogress"?


## Misc thoughts

It's nice that we can add whatever files we want to the
`entomologist-data` branch.  We could add a directory of report
definitions, and have them be shared across the project, and not have
to type them out every time.
