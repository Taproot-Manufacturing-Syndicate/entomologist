teach `ent sync` to scan `main` branch commits for special commands

I'm thinking primarily of "Fixes: abc123" but maybe there are others?

ent could be informed of the main branch name via
entomologist-data:config.toml, and use a special tag pointing at the
most recent commit in that branch that it has processed.  When you run
`ent sync`, after it runs `git fetch` it could log the main branch from
its tagged commit to the just-fetched branch head, read all the commit
messages, and find and process all the ent commands.  Then finally move
its tag to the new main branch head.

This way you could put an ent command like "Fixes: abc123" in a bugfix
commit, and after you merge that branch to main, the next ent sync will
mark issue abc123 as done for you.
