Oops, i stupidly ran: ent new "add `ent sync --dry-run`"

Because i used double-quotes, bash saw the `...` and ran that as a
command, which failed, but then bash ran the result anyway ("ent new
"add "), and here we are.

This would be a good time for `ent rm` as suggested by issue
1ebdee0502937bf934bb0d72256dbdd1.
