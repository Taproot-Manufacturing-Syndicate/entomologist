Yeah that red blob ðŸ›‘ is super heavy, and the octagonal shape is pretty
subtle - it looks more like a stop light than a stop sign.

I like your thought of somehow showing the state of the issues we
dependend on...  How about showing the count of not-Done dependencies?
And once all the dependencies are Done, not showing the â†– or âŒ› or
whatever at all.

In the `ent show` output we could list all dependencies with a â†– or
âŒ› for the not-Done ones and a âœ… for the Done ones.
