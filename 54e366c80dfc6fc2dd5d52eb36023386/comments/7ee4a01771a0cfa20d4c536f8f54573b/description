We can determine something like an "mtime" for an Issue by running a
command like:

`git log --pretty=format:%ai --max-count 1 entomologist-data -- ${ISSUE_ID}`

Running it on `${ISSUE_ID}/comments` gives you the most recent time
there was a commit in the comments directory, indicating a new or
edited comment.
