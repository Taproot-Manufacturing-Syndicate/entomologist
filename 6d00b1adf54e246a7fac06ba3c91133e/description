`ent sync` fails if there's no `entomologist-data` on remote

1. I created a new git repo on machine A using `git init`.

2. I some entomologist issues in that repo using `ent new`.

3. `ent sync` fails:
    ```
    $ ent sync
    stdout:
    stderr: fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.

    Error: Oops, something went wrong
    ```

4. I created a new bare repo on machine B with `git init --bare`.

5. I added repo B as a remote in repo A.

6. `ent sync` still fails:
    ```
    $ ent sync
    Sync failed!  'git log' error!  Help, a human needs to fix the mess in "entomologist-data"
    stdout:
    stderr: fatal: ambiguous argument 'origin/entomologist-data': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
    Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:
    'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'

    Error: Oops, something went wrong
    ```

For now the workaround is to `git push` the `entomologist-data` branch
first.  But this should be fixed.
