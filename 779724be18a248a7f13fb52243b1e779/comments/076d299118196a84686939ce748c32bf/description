`ent sync` works but `ent list` fails.

`ent sync` and `ent list` both call
`entomologist::database::make_issues_database()`.

`sync` makes a RW db:
    Worktree::new()
    git creates the local branch:
        $ git worktree add /tmp/foo entomologist-data
        Preparing worktree (new branch 'entomologist-data')
        branch 'entomologist-data' set up to track 'origin/entomologist-data'.
        HEAD is now at 478926a change state of issue 779724be18a248a7f13fb52243b1e779, new -> inprogress

`list` makes a RO db:
    Worktree::new_detached()
    git does not create a local branch:
        $ git worktree add --detach /tmp/foo entomologist-data
        fatal: invalid reference: entomologist-data

In both cases, ent's `main` tries to create the `entomologist-data`
branch if it does not exist, but there's a bug in branch detection: it
uses `git show-ref {branch}`, which matches the filename of any file in
`.git/refs/`, including `.git/refs/remotes/origin/entomologist-data`.

This check should probably be fixed and moved into `database.rs`.
The fixed check should do this:

1. If `refs/heads/{branch}` already exists, return success.

2. If `git show-ref` finds *any* matching name, create branch `{branch}`
   from the first one found.

3. Otherwise create a new empty `entomologist-data` branch.
