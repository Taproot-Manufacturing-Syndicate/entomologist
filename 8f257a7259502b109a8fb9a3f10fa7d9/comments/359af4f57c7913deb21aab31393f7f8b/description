This fails because in a brand-new repo there are no commits, and HEAD
is not valid.  When entomologist tries to create the `entomologist-data`
branch, it first creates a new detached worktree from HEAD, which fails.

We could potentially maybe use `git show-ref` (maybe in the form of
`entomologist::git::git_branch_exists()` to see if HEAD is valid,
and *if not* then skip the new worktree business and just work in the
current worktree.
