`ent new` doesn't work in a brand-new empty repo

1. `git init repo-dir`

2. `cd repo-dir`

3. ent new "a new issue":
```
$ ent new
stdout:
stderr: fatal: invalid reference: HEAD

Error: Oops, something went wrong
```

Creating a single valid commit, even an empty one, makes it work:

4. `git commit --allow-empty -m "empty commit"`

5. `ent new "a new issue"`
