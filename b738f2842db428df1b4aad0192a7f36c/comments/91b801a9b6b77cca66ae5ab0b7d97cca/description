# `ent list FILTER` filter format

I'm not sure about the filter format, but here are some notes...

There are (as of df7b5c6aa4a00dfca66dc802f1e813f23f27a5b9) two independent
filters: "state" and "assignee".  The "state" filter defaults to
including issues whose state is InProgress, Blocked, Backlog, or New.
The "assignee" filter defaults to including all issues, assigned or not.

The two filters can be independently overridden by the `ent list
FILTER` command.  FILTER is a string containing "chunks" separated by
":", like the PATH environment variable.  Each chunk is of the form
"name=value[,value...]".  "name" can currently be either "state" or
"assignee", and we can add more in the future (e.g "tag" or "ctime").

The "value" arguments to the "state" filter must be one of the valid
states, or it's a parse error.

The "value" arguments to the "assignee" filter are used to
string-compare against the issues "assignee" field, exact matches are
accepted and everything else is rejected.  A special assignee filter of
the empty string matches issues that don't have an assignee.

Some examples:

* `ent list` shows issues in the states listed above, and don't filter
  based on assignee at all.

* `ent list assignee=seb` shows issues in the states listed above,
  but only if the assignee is "seb".

* `ent list assignee=seb,` shows issues in the states listed above,
  but only if the assignee is "seb" or if there is no assignee.

* `ent list state=done` shows all issues in the Done state.

* `ent list state=inprogress:assignee=seb` shows issues in the InProgress
  state that are assigned to "seb".
