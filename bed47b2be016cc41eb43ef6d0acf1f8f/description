make issue assignment more flexible

I think there are two things i want that don't currently work:
* add some way to un-assign a person from an issue
* support multiple people assigned to the same issue


# Backend implemetation

Current situation:

* the Issue struct has an Option<String> `assignee` field

* the Issue directory has an optional file named `assignee`, which
  (if present) contains a single line with the current assignee

Proposed new situation:

* the Issue struct has a Vec<String> `assignee` field

* the Issue directory has an optional directory named `assignee`,
  containing a file per assignee.  The name of each file is the name of
  that assignee.  All assignee files are empty.


# CLI UI

I like the current CLI of `ent assign ISSUE PERSON`, it feels natural
in a "zero or one assignees per issue" world, though it currently lacks
the ability to express "remove this assignee from the issue".

How to extend it to a "zero or more assignees per issue" world, that
includes the ability to arbitrarily add & remove assignees from issues?

Possible new CLI ui:

* `ent assign ISSUE PERSON` adds PERSON(s) to the assignee list
* `ent assign ISSUE -PERSON` removes the PERSON(s) from the assignee list

That has the expressive range we need, and matches how `ent tag`
currently works.

Probably allow any number of `PERSON` and/or `-PERSON` on the same
command line.
