changes to the ent filesystem break older versions of ent


recently with the dependency API, i updated the ent DB with an entry which contains a dependency, and has an updated method of storing them (files inside of a directory instead of a file with a list of dependencies) 

this has caused a problem with mainline `ent` showing the following error: 

because mainline `ent` expects there to be a file with a list of dependencies, and when it goes to open the file, it errors, since it's actually a directory with the same name as what it expects the file to be named. 

we should probably make it so if `ent` doesn't understand something, it does not completely exit... at least in some cases? 

or enforce some kind of versioning on the DB or something... not entirely sure.
