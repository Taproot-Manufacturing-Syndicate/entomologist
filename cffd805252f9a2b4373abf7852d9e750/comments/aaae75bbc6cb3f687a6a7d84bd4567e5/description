got the initial framework laid out tonight - some of the naming i'm still not happy with, so it'll take some staring at that to figure out what feels right. 

i'm not entirely sure the direction of... type responsibility..? that this is implementing is correct either, but we'll see. 

right now i have a two test cases, one which is passing, and the other which isn't passing yet, because i still have `todo!()`s for the vec implementation (needs to make a dir) 

dir naming is another thing i'm not totally happy about yet as well.


but it's a start!
