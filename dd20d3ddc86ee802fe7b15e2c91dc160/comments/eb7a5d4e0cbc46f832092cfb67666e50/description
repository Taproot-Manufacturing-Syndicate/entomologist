I opted for the "escaped files" design, not the "nested directories"
design, because i think "escaped files" is totally conflict free, while
"nested dirs" has a git conflict if one user adds the tag `tui` (creating
the file `ISSUE/tags/tui`) and another adds `tui/v0.1` (creating the
directory `ISSUE/tags/tui/` and the file `ISSUE/tags/tui/v0.1`).
