commit messages in the `entomologist-data` branch could be better

It'd be nice to be able to look at the `git log --oneline` of an issue dir and see:
* creating the issue
* editing the issue
* changing state or assignee
* adding a comment
* editing a comment

I think each kind of log message we want will correspond to a matching
API function in the entomologist crate.
